    <h4>
        <p>Steve Jobs was the co-founder and two-time CEO of Apple Inc. Undoubtedly a brillient businessman, Steve is also considered to be on of the greatest tech visionaries of our time.<br>
            <br> Steve's life story is nothing short of fascinating. After dropping out of college, he joined forces with his friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> to start Apple in 1976. A year later, the duo
            gained wealth and fame thanks to the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. This was followed by be the hugely successful Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a Graphical
            User Interface (GUI). After being ousted from Apple in 1985, Steve went on to oversee the creation of 2 new companies: NeXT and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar">Pixar</a>. The success of the movie Toy Story made Steve a billionaire.<br>
            <br> In 1997, Steve returned to Apple, with the company on the brink of extinction. Nonetheless, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">Steve was a tremendous salesman</a>, and was able to use his business acumen
            to slowly turn Apple's fortunes around and bring the company back to profitibility.
